C- is a programming lanuage designed for kernel development or just learning, I use AI to develop this language while I modified it a bit, this language was made under 2 hours because the langauge was super simple and easy.
The keywords are: set, list, true, false, log(), func(), while, if, else, end, void, null, do, then, and for.
The syntax is that you have to put ; at the end of every line no matter what, very simple syntax,
This language doesnt have operators yet, and I suck in Lua or any high level language becuase I love low level more, which is why this language was developed use AI.
I actually made this language out of rage because C was very complicated unlike rust, but then I reliazed i made this language for no reason considering Rust is very great for me.
This language is made under 300 lines of Lua code which is literally like less than 10 KB (8.2 KB for the entire language to be exact).
This language is very limited, only log() and set keywords for for me, i dont know why, I wish i was great in Lua but appearntly i need AI so, i couldnt figure out the logic of my own language because it was made in AI, and I apologize for using AI if that annoys you.
C- compiles to C which is why its very fast, C- also has no libraries, no garbage collecter, and no parameters.
This README file isnt over yet, I will explain it more later.
