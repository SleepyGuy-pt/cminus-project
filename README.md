C- is a programming language designed for kernel development or just learning, this language was made under 2 hours because the langauge was super simple and easy.
The keywords are: set, list, true, false, log(), func(), while, if, else, end, void, null, do, then, and for.
The syntax is that you have to put ; at the end of every line no matter what, very simple syntax,
This language doesnt have operators yet, and I suck in Lua or any high level language becuase I love low level more,I actually made this language out of rage because C was very complicated unlike rust, but then I realized I made this language for no reason considering C and other languages actually work fine for me.
This language is made under 300 lines of Lua code which is literally like less than 10 KB (8.2 KB for the entire language to be exact).
This language is very limited, only log() and set keywords for for me, i dont know why, I used AI for some stuff so the syntax and keywords logic may be not as what I wanted, 
C- compiles to C which C then compiles to machine code which is why its very fast, C- also has no libraries, no garbage collecter, and no parameters.
